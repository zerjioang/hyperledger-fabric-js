# Hyperledger Fabric JS Bridge

Webpack based boilerplate for producing libraries (Input: ES6, Output: universal library)

## Design features

* Webpack 3 based.
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so your library works everywhere.
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
* Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
